Dataset: Synthetic dataset from Various official website of the company and from google images and Pinterest website.

On (Colab1) colab:
Using TensorFlow develop the sequence model with CNN and test the model with test data.

On (Colab2) colab:
To enhance the dataset using resizing, rescale, flip, rotation, zooming on the dataset extended the quantity and can make model to train well better previous model. The accuracy on the test data is 83 and loss is 36.

To improve used callback on the model to store the model weight and bias to carry on the net epochs but it minimize the accuracy and maximize the loss.

Tried to develop the local website but failed to connect vscode from colab to create a user interface they stopped the service.

Tried to work on vscode from scratch to develop classification but system is not supported to work.

I will work to develop my local website and update with github sooner.
